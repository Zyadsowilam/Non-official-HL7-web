     <p> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HL7 AND FHIR?</p>
     <p>HL7 is a set of international data-sharing standards that are meant to enhance healthcare interoperability. HL7 is a clinical 
</p>     
 <p>messaging format that supports secure exchange of documents and healthcare messaging between healthcare organizations. HL7 uses 
</p>
  <p>
    ASCII text-based messages to communicate between different systems, such as patient management systems, healthcare information systems, EMRs, laboratory information systems, and billing systems. On the other hand, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was released in 2014, as an alternative to HL7 v2, as an open standard that enables new apps and legacy systems to more easily exchange data than in the past. This move hopes to improve interoperability and enhance the efficiency of communication. Based on RESTful principles, FHIR aims to accelerate the implementation of HL7 and enhance 

  </p>
  <p>
    interaction between legacy healthcare systems, as well as allow users to gain access to medical data from various devices.

       <p>HL7 and its members provide a framework that defines the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. HL7 standards define a process for how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another, as well as the language which is to be used, and the correct structure and data types required for seamless integration between systems. HL7 standards support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services. Some common pirmary HL7 standards include Clinical Document Architecture (CDA®) Products, context management specifications, HL7 Version 2 Product Suite, HL7 Version 3 Product Suite, while Messaging and document standards for clinical specialties and groups include Arden Syntax, HL7/ANSI standards, HL7 Consumer Mobile Health Application Functional Framework, HL7 EHR-S Functional Requirements, and hundreds of others.
      </p>
      <p>FHIR® is also an interoperability standard of HL7 intended to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information between healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, payers, researchers, and anyone else involved in the healthcare ecosystem. FHIR contains two sections; content model in the form of ‘resources’, and a specification for the exchange of these resources via RESTful interfaces as well as messaging and Documents.
      </p>
      <p>Some common FHIR standards include HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Specification, HL7 FHIR® IG: Payer Coverage Decision Exchange, HL7 FHIR® Implementation Guides on Bulk Data, bidirectional services, C-CDA on FHIR, clinical decision support for immunization, coverage requirements discovery, consumer-facing real time pharmacy benefit check, electronic case reporting, healthcare associated infection reports, payer coverage decision exchange, consumer directed payer data 
      </p>
      <p>exchange, structured and unstructured data capture, unsolicited notifications, and data exchange for quality measures.

        FHIR is known to help researchers with the exchange of information, and its two sectors collectively ensure better resource management. However, how the FHIR system is developed can impact the information exchange between the researchers. For this reason, you must choose the vendor that conducts in-depth UX research in healthcare to ensure the information exchange is secure, optimized, and error-free.
