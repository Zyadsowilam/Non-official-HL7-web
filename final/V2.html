        </h3>
            
        <p> HL7 Version 2.x (V2) messaging standard is the workhorse of electronic data exchange in the clinical domain and arguably the most widely implemented standard for healthcare in the world. This messaging standard allows the exchange of clinical data between systems.
             It is designed to support a central patient care system as well as a more distributed environment where data resides in departmental systems.</p>

             <p>As one of the most widely implemented standards for healthcare information in the world,
                  the Version 2 Messaging Standard was first released in October 1987 as an Application Protocol for Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Environments.
                  Version 2.7, representing the latest update to the Version 2 Standard, was published in 2011.</p>
            
                <p>Due to its widespread use, Version 2 will continue to play an integral part in healthcare messaging, even with the HL7 Version 3 Normative Edition.
                     HL7 is committed to supporting and extending Version 2 in parallel with Version 3, providing continuity for current installations.For more information <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185"> Click here. </a></p>

            </div>
           <h3>Description</h3>
           <p>he HL7 Version 3 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA®) is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents" for the purpose of exchange between healthcare providers and patients.
                It defines a clinical document as having the following six characteristics: 1) Persistence, 2) Stewardship,
                 3) Potential for authentication, 4) Context, 5) Wholeness and 6) Human readability.</p>

                 <p>A CDA can contain any type of clinical content -- typical CDA documents would be a Discharge Summary, Imaging Report, Admission & Physical, Pathology Report and more.
                      The most popular use is for inter-enterprise information exchange, such as is envisioned for a US Health Information Exchange (HIE).</p>

             <h3>Development Background</h3>
             <p>CDA® grew out of work that originated outside of HL7 in early 1996 when a group of physicians including Tom Lincoln, John Spinosa, Dan Essin, John Mattison and Bob Dolin began to meet to discuss the potential for structured markup in clinical documents.
                 The earliest draft was called the Kona Architecture and was developed in 1997 after the group had joined HL7.</p>
            
                <p>Since that time, many people have worked on it and the basic ideas have been refined and developed along with the HL7 Version 3 framework and the Reference Information Model (RIM).
                     The original group morphed into the HL7 Structured Documents Work Group which is responsible for CDA and other HL7 document types.For more information <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7"> Click here. </a></p>

           <p>FHIR is an interoperability standard intended to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information between healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, payers,
                researchers, and any one else involved in the healthcare ecosystem. It consists of 2 main parts – a content model in the form of ‘resources’,
                and a specification for the exchange of these resources in the form of real-time RESTful interfaces as well as messaging and Documents.</p>

            </div>       
                <h3>Description</h3>
           <p>The Health Level Seven Version 3 (V3) Normative Edition—a suite of specifications based on HL7’s Reference Information Model (RIM)—provides a single source that allows implementers of V3 specifications to work with the full set of messages, data types, and terminologies needed to build a complete implementation. The 2015 Normative Edition represents the seventh publication of the complete suite of V3 specifications, and contains those Version 3 Standards that are ANSI Approved, those that have passed Normative Level Ballot and are awaiting final ANSI Approval, and Draft Standards for Trial Use (DSTU). It includes standards for communications that document and manage the care and treatment of patients in a wide variety of healthcare settings. As such, it is a foundational part of the technologies needed to meet the global challenge of integrating healthcare information, in areas such as patient care and public health.
                    
            <p>
                The Version 3 Normative Edition represents a new approach to clinical information exchange based on a model driven methodology that produces messages and electronic documents expressed in XML syntax. The V3 specification is built around subject domains that provide storyboard descriptions, trigger events, interaction designs, domain object models derived from the RIM, hierarchical message descriptors (HMDs) and a prose description of each element. Implementation of these domains further depends upon a non-normative V3 Guide and normative specifications for: data types; the XML technical specifications (ITS) or message wire format; message and control "wrappers", and transport protocols.

Ontario has developed V3 messages for referrals.  The Western Provinces have developed Chronic Disease Management V3 messages and many of them have implemented them.

             <h3>Development Background</h3>
             <p>CVersion 3 represents a significant departure from "business as usual" for HL7. Offering a lot of optionality and thus flexibility, the V2.x series of messages are widely implemented and very successful. These messages evolved over several years using a "bottom-up" approach that has addressed individual needs through an implied methodology that, in lieu of a pre-defined implementation guide, typically depends on bi-lateral negotiations between participating HIT system implementations. There is neither a consistent view of the data that HL7 moves nor the data's relationship to other data. HL7's V2 success is also largely attributable to its flexibility. It contains many optional data elements and data segments, making it adaptable to almost any site. While providing great flexibility, its optionality also contributes to an inability to support reliable conformance testing and also requires implementers to spend more time analyzing and planning their interfaces to ensure that both parties are using the same optional features.</p>
            
                <p>HL7's primary goal for Version 3 is to offer a standard that is definite and testable, and provide the ability to certify vendors' conformance.</p>
